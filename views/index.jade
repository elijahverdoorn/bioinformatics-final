    &nbsp> Needleman-Wunsch Online is a tool designed to walk through the otherwise traumatic steps of the NW algorithm, a powerhouse in dynamic sequence alignment. Needleman Wunsch is a method for aligning two sequences of Nucleotides or amino Acids by finding and concurrently scoring a grid of boxes in four quadrants, then evaluating the total scoring of each box to determine a physical alignment. This tool provides a walk through of the computations involved behind the scenes, and alleviates the pain of performing the algorithm by hand.
